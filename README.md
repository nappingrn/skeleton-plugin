# skeleton-plugin for OpenOSRS
Greetings, it took me a while to figure out how to make a plugin from scratch or at least find a place to copy from because im lazy so i made this repo

anyway, all you do is:
  1) download this folder, drop it into your plugins project (rename it to "skeletonplugin" if it didn't download as such)
  2) add  include(":skeletonplugin") in your settings.gradle.kts file, in the plugins folder
  3) build the plugins project
  4) make your own plugin and rename as you want to!
  
  and you should be able to just make whatever inside of this more or less
 
 this might not be the best way and this was partially an excercise for me, hope it helps out one of you!
